# Auction Strategies for Random Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for various auction strategy problems under different bidding scenarios, developed as part of the **Quant Guild Selections 2024–25**.

The primary goal of these strategies is to optimize expected payoff across multiple auction variants and setups.

## 📝 Problem Context

The problem statements are detailed under the **"Trading Bots PS"** document provided during the selection process. Each variant involves a different type of auction mechanism, requiring tailored approaches to bidding and valuation strategies.

## 📊 Contents

- Final strategy implementations for each auction variant  
- Supporting code for simulation and evaluation  
- An in-depth report explaining the logic, assumptions, and analysis behind each strategy

## 📄 Report

Refer to the `Report.pdf` for a comprehensive explanation of each strategy, including:
- Decision logic
- Scenario-specific optimization
- Risk Management

Refer to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/ajoymathew07/Auction-strats-for-random-assignments/tree/main/Auction%20Bots%20Starter%20Code/README.md) in  **Auction Bots Starter Code** directory for instructions on how to run and simulate each auction variant.
