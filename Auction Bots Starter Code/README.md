# Auction Bots

### Using the code
Create a copy of the file Template.py, in the folder Strategies. \
Implement your strategy in this copied file.\
You can create multiple such copies, to test out your strategy against other strategies.
Feel free to delete the existing strategies. We have only provided them as reference.

#### Simulating the auction
In the terminal, go to the location where `Auction.py` is located.\
To simulate Variant 1 of the auction, use the command `python Variant_1.py`\
Other variants can be similarly simulated.\\
A per round basis execution report can be obtained using the command `python Variant_1.py -log`
The log output can be captured in a file debug.txt using the command `python Variant_1.py -log >debug.txt`
